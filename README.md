This project was my submission for a job application assessment. It is a simple landing page for a real estate website.

I built it with NextJS, Tailwind CSS and Typescript. Redux toolkit was used for state management and data fetching. Forms were handled with react-hook-form. 
Dynamic data was generated with [https://mockapi.io](https://mockapi.io)

Please leave a star, and check out my other projects.
